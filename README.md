# simple-DFT
A simple DFT code in jupyter. 
Specifically, its a 1D plane wave implementation. The interaction is that of electrons harmonically confined to a wire. The parametrized correlation energy of M. Casula et al. [1] is used.  It is aimed for educational use, thus the code is kept very simple.
